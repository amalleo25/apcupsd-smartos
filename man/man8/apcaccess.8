.Os apcaccess v3.14.6
.Sh NAME
.Nm apcaccess
.Nd retrieve status information from apcupsd(8)
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm 
[-f <config-file>] [-h <host>[:<port>]] [-p <parameter-name>] [-u] [<command>] [<host>[:<port>]]
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a program which prints out the complete status of most American Power 
Conversion Corp. (APC) UPSes provided you have the
.Xr apcupsd 8
daemon installed, properly configured and running. It can access status
information from any APC UPS attached to the localhost or attached to 
any computer on the network which is running apcuspd in NIS mode.
.Pp
The command line options are:
.Bl -hang -width "<command>"
.It -f
configuration file of apcupsd (default is usually /etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.conf)
.It -h 
hostname and port of apcupsd to communicate with.  The default hostname and port are obtained from the configuration file.
.It -p
Report only the value of the named parameter instead of all parameters and values.
.It -u
Remove units field for easier parsing by scripts.
.It <command>
An optional command, unless a hostname is also being specified. The only implemented command is
.Em status\&
Shorthand for
.Em status\& localhost:3551 .
This produces a full printout of the available status information for the 
associated UPS.
.It <host>
An optional hostname which may be a bare machine name, fully qualified 
domain name or IP address.
.It :<port>
An optional port number where a hostname argument has been specified. The 
default is 3551, the official port number assigned by 
.Tn IANA 
for the apcupsd NIS server.  The default hostname and port are obtained from the configuration file.
.El
.Pp
.Nm 
uses apcupsd's inbuilt Network Information Server (NIS) -- no relation 
to Sun's NIS/YP service -- to obtain the current status information from the 
UPS on the local or remote computer. It is therefore
necessary to have the following configuration directives:
.Pp
.Bl -item -compact
.It
        NETSERVER on
.It 
        NISPORT 3551
.El
.Pp
in the
.Pa /etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.conf
configuration file so that the Network Information Server will be accessible.
Firewall rules for appropriate network access may also be needed.
.Sh STATUS REPORT FORMAT
The status report output format is simple ASCII. Generally there
is a single piece of information on each line of output. The
content varies based on the model of UPS being used and, in some cases,
the firmware version. 
.Sh EXAMPLES
Set out below is a sample of the status output which may be
generated for the specified UPS models.
